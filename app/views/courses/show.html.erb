        <p class="govuk-body">Teaching cybersecurity in schools is an important
          way to help students stay safe while using technology. On this course,
          teachers will be introduced to the core ideas of cybersecurity that
          should be taught in the classroom.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will learn the different attacks that
          individuals and devices are vulnerable to and how to prevent them. You
          will explore malware, malicious bots, SQL injections, and physical
          threats to data. You will also build your knowledge of the different
          tools that protect data and websites. These include strong passwords,
          biometrics, two-factor authentication, and firewalls.</p>
