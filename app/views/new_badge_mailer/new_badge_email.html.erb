  <p class='govuk-body'>TeachComputing.org digital badges are awarded through a system called Credly. They are a formal record of your CPD and allow you to demonstrate your skills, expertise and commitment to personal development.</p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to accept and view your badge:</h3>
  <p class='govuk-body'>To accept your badge, follow these easy steps:</p>
  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list govuk-list--number">

      You will shortly receive an email from Credly with a link to accept your badge. If you are an existing Credly account holder, follow the link, log in and see your new badge, alongside any other badges you have already been awarded (through us or via other platforms).
