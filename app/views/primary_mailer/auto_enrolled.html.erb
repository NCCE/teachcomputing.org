  <p class="govuk-body">Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Did you know that you're already well on your way to gaining a nationally recognised certificate?</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We can see you've been working on your professional development, by engaging in courses that are part of the <b>Teach primary computing certificate</b> on <%= link_to "TeachComputing.org", root_url %>. To help you take the next step towards achieving this national accreditation, which is awarded by BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, we've enrolled you on the certificate.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This means that you'll now be able to access your own personal dashboard, where you can find out more about the certificate and the next steps required to achieving it.</p>
  <p class='govuk-body'><%= link_to "Explore your personal dashboard", primary_certificate_url, class: 'govuk-button button' %></p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Next steps...</strong></p>
  <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
    <li>Explore your dashboard which shows courses and activities for you to engage with – you can change your pathway at any point</li>
    <li>Complete a minimum of six hours of <%= link_to "CPD", courses_url(certificate: "primary-certificate") %> – you might have already achieved that part of the certificate!</li>
    <li>Develop your teaching practice – a great place to start is downloading and using a <%= link_to "Teach Computing Curriculum resource", curriculum_key_stages_url %> then reflecting on how you adapted it in the classroom</li>
    <li>Develop computing in your community – you could expand on the above point in your journey and share tips on using a resource in your classroom, with colleagues on the <%= link_to "STEM Community", stem_community_url %></li>
    <li>Receive your nationally accredited certificate!</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Not the right time?</strong></p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you don't want to continue on the programme at this time, let us know and we'll update our records. You can still re-enrol yourself in the future on <%= link_to "our website.", primary_certificate_url %></p>
