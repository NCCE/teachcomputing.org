Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Did you know that you're already well on your way to gaining a nationally recognised certificate?
We can see you've been working on your professional development, by engaging in courses that are part of the Teach primary computing certificate on TeachComputing.org. To help you take the next step towards achieving this national accreditation, which is awarded by BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, we've enrolled you on the certificate.
This means that you'll now be able to access your own personal dashboard, where you can find out more about the certificate and the next steps required to achieving it.

Explore your personal dashboard (<%= primary_certificate_url %>)

Next steps...
* Explore your dashboard which shows courses and activities for you to engage with – you can change your pathway at any point
* Complete a minimum of six hours of CPD (<%= courses_url(certificate: "primary-certificate") %>) – you might have already achieved that part of the certificate!
* Develop your teaching practice – a great place to start is downloading and using a Teach Computing Curriculum resource (<%= curriculum_key_stages_url %>) then reflecting on how you adapted it in the classroom
* Develop computing in your community – you could expand on the above point in your journey and share tips on using a resource in your classroom, with colleagues on the STEM Community (<%= stem_community_url %>).
* Receive your nationally accredited certificate!

Not the right time?
If you don't want to continue on the programme at this time, let us know and we'll update our records. You can still re-enrol yourself in the future on our website (<%= primary_certificate_url %>)
