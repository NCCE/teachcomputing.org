          <p class="govuk-body">The National Centre for Computing Education
          is establishing a network of 40 Computing Hubs to deliver a school-led system of leadership of
          education across England.
          The network will be led by schools and colleges with an exceptional track record in teaching
          computing.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Computing Hubs will provide local, responsive and appropriately tailored
          support available to all computing teachers in state primary and secondary schools and colleges in
          their area, collectively providing national coverage.
          They will be the focal point for local computing CPD, and will draw upon local expertise to provide
          a range of CPD opportunities for all teachers, with a particular focus on teachers in schools in
          category 5 and 6 Local Authority Districts.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">The first 10 Hubs will be contracted from May 2019 to act as flag bearers for
          the NCCE, working with us on the development of systems and processes. The remaining 30 Hubs will
          be operational by September 2019. <%= link_to 'Find out how your school can apply', 'https://www.stem.org.uk/opportunities-tender', class: 'ncce-link' %></p>
