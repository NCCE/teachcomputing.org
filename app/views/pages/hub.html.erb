          <p class="govuk-body">A key component of the National Centre for Computing Education
          is a network of 40 computing hubs. These will be led by great schools and colleges with an
          exceptional track record in teaching computing. They will be resourced to ensure that
          the CPD delivered through the network meets the real needs of computing teachers in their regions.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Computing Hubs will provide local, responsive and appropriately tailored support
          available to all computing teachers in state primary and secondary schools and colleges in their area,
          collectively providing national coverage. Computing Hubs will be the focal point for local computing CPD,
          and will draw upon local expertise to provide a range of CPD opportunities for all teachers
          with a particular focus on teachers in schools in category 5 and 6 Local Authority Districts.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">The first 10 Hubs will be contracted from May 2019 to act as flag bearers
          for the NCCE and working with us on the development of systems and processes. The
            remaining 30 Hubs will be operational by
          September 2019. To find out more about how your school can apply please click <%= link_to 'https://www.stem.org.uk/opportunities-tender', '/', class: 'ncce-link' %></p>
