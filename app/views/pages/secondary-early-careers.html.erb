          Strong subject knowledge is paramount to successfully delivering any area of the curriculum. Your first step to success is to access our Computer Science Accelerator, which will develop your subject knowledge up to GCSE. <a href="https://static.teachcomputing.org/pathways/01_New_to_computing.pdf">Our new to computing pathway</a> is a great way for non-specialist trainees or early career teachers to engage with the programme.
