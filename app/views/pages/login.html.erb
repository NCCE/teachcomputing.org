          <p class="govuk-body">STEM is part of the NCCE consortium and is providing the
          booking and registration systems for the NCCE site.
          Using this existing system enables us to get up and running
          quickly in order to provide you with access to training right away.
          At some point in the future we hope to have a more integrated single
          sign-on system across all our partners' platforms.
