				<p class="govuk-body-s">Each unit of work features pre-recorded, high quality, and fun computing lessons that are grouped by Key Stage. The lessons can either be accessed independently by students, or introduced by a teacher or parent as a school time session.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body-s">If a student needs further help with something in one of the lessons, they can attend a live drop-in session held by the expert computing teachers at our School Hubs.</p>
