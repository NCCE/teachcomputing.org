        <p class="govuk-body">Home teaching is a new programme designed to help students to continue their computing studies while at home. Teachers and parents will be able to schedule the activities as part of the school day.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">Using our network of Computing Hubs and our consortium resources, we are providing you with a timetable of sequential, topic-led activities and live online support during the summer term. The programme will cover all priority curriculum topics, across all key stages.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">The activities</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The units of work feature high-quality and fun computing activities that are grouped by key stage.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">If a student needs further help with an activity, they can attend one of our live drop-in sessions held online by the expert computing teachers at our School Hubs. These Q&A sessions will be available every day to help explain the key principles of the weekly featured topics, and identify misconceptions.</p>
