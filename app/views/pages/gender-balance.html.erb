					<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
						<li>Comprised of four research themes, across seven interventions</li>
						<li>Run across four years</li>
						<li>In 500 primary schools and 250 secondary schools in England</li>

				<p class="govuk-body">Gender Balance in Computing is a collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation; STEM Learning; BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT; the Behavioural Insights Team; Apps for Good; and WISE.</p>
				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this research is important</h2>
				<p class="govuk-body">Sadly, many young women do not see computing-related subjects as an option for their future career. Research suggests that a variety of factors are likely to be responsible, including feeling like they don’t belong in the subject or its community, a lack of sustained encouragement, and a lack of computing role models when they are learning about the subject.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">The Gender Balance in Computing research programme aims to find out what works to encourage girls to develop an interest during their primary and secondary school years, and increase the number of young women who choose to study Computer Science at GCSE and A level. We are running a number of pilot studies and Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) to assess the impact of different types of intervention on female pupil’s engagement in computing. We use standardised surveys measuring different aspects of engagement and attitudes towards computing, as well as intention to study GCSE computing, to measure the impact of the interventions.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What’s currently happening with the programme?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body"><%= link_to 'Visit our overview page', '/gender-balance-interventions', class: 'ncce-link', data: tracking('interventions') %> to learn about each of the interventions and our key findings as we share them.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We are currently working with schools and teachers to deliver the interventions. All of the trials are now fully recruited, and while some have taken place and the data has been collected, others are still underway. We will start to share the results through a variety of publications once they have been completed, likely starting in the summer of 2022.</p>

					<p class='govuk-body'>Over the last two years, we have been writing regular blog posts on issues relating to gender balance in computing, including tips for teachers to try out in their classrooms.</p>
