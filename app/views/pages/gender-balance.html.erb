						<li>Six different research trials</li>
						<li>Run across four years</li>
						<li>In over 1000 state schools in England</li>
					</ul>

				<p class="govuk-body">The Gender Balance in Computing (GBIC) research programme is an amazing opportunity to find out what works to encourage girls to develop an interest during their primary and secondary school years, and increase the number of young women who choose to study Computer Science at GCSE and A level.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">GBIC is a collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation; STEM Learning; BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT; the Behavioural Insights Team, Apps for Good and WISE.</p>
				<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why this research is important</h2>
				<p class="govuk-body">Sadly, many young women do not see computing-related subjects as an option for their future career. Research suggests that a variety of factors are likely to be responsible, including feeling like they don’t belong in the subject or its community, a lack of sustained encouragement, and a lack of computing role models when they are learning about the subject.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">We’re working with schools to find ways to address this disparity.</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">More than 700 amazing schools have already begun working with us to explore the different approaches to meet this challenge, but we need more!</p>
				<p class="govuk-body">We’ll provide free teaching and learning materials, as well as training where necessary. All we need you to do is to try the approaches we suggest and provide us with some information through surveys and perhaps a phone call or visit from us. We’d love your school to get involved. <strong>Why not join today?<strong></p>
