      <p class="govuk-body">We may share your information with other relevant organisations if you are asked and you agree that your information can be shared in that way.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">As part of the services offered to you through the National Centre for Computing Education, the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK. By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. When transferring your information outside of the EU in this way, we take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected. For example, if using a service in the US it is signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">8. How long we keep your information for</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We keep your information for no longer than is necessary for our purposes, or for any period required by law, for example for compliance with HMRC requirements, if this is longer. What is necessary will depend on the reason for which the information was collected. We are developing a data retention schedule and will share this in due course.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you have any questions about how long we keep your information, contact us at <a href="mailto:datasecurity@stem.org.uk">datasecurity@stem.org.uk</a></p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">9. Your rights</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Right of access</strong> — you have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to request access to this information.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Right to rectification</strong> — it is your responsibility to see that the information held on the website is up to date. We may also update some information if we identify it is out of date, for example a school closes and reopens with a different name. You may ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate, and you may also ask us to remove information which is inaccurate or incomplete. If you inform us that your personal data is inaccurate, we will inform relevant third parties with whom we have shared your data so that they may update their own records.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">In order to ensure we do not hold any out of date information for individuals we regularly remove registered users for whom we do not have a valid email address; this includes those accounts to which the email address has been reported as undeliverable.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Right of portability</strong> — you have a right to obtain your personal data from us and reuse it for your own purposes.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Right to be forgotten</strong> — You have a right to seek the erasure of your data, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to continue holding or processing your personal data. This right is not absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Right to restriction</strong> — you have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-body">
        <li>You contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate.</li>
        <li>You ask us to restrict use of it instead of deleting it.</li>
        <li>We no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish or defend legal claims.</li>
        <li>You have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our legitimate interests. If you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information for the purpose of exercising or defending legal claims, for the purpose of protecting the rights of another person, or for public interest reasons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can always unsubscribe from any marketing emails. There is a link at the bottom of each email. If you have any problems unsubscribing please email <a href="mailto:info@teachcomputing.org">info@teachcomputing.org</a>.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Accessing your personal information</strong> — you can find out if we hold any personal information by making a ‘subject access request’. If we do hold information about you we will:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-body">
        <li>give you a description of it</li>
        <li>tell you why we are holding it</li>
        <li>tell you who it could be disclosed to</li>
        <li>let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">To make a request for any personal information we may hold or exercise any of your rights, you need to put the request in writing addressing it to: The Data Protection Officer, STEM Learning, University of York, York, YO10 5DD.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We may ask for your help in locating specific information and confirming your identity. We will act in accordance with your instructions as soon as reasonably possible, and there will be no charge.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example by providing you with the specific information you need over the telephone.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our use of your data processed in the UK is regulated by the Information Commissioner. You have a right to report any of your concerns about our use of your data to the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
