              Part of the STEM Ambassadors volunteer programme â€“ Computing Ambassadors are people from a wide range of industries who can help bring your computing (and any other) lessons to life and provide real-world context, creating an invaluable link between schools and industry.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body-s">
              Computing Ambassadors can visit your school, introduce a topic, judge a competition or just show pupils who they can grow up to be in the future.
