            <p class="govuk-body">Computer science is the fastest-growing STEM subject, and yet, despite its popularity, girls are consistently outnumbered by boys. In 2023, only one in five GCSE Computer Science and 15% of all A level Computer Science entries were from female students in England.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Our evidence-informed programme aims to help teachers and leaders understand the barriers to girls’ participation in computer science and make a plan to overcome them. We offer curated resources, training and implementation support to empower you with the tools to support more girls into computer science qualifications and careers.</p>
