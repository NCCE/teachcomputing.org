            – Collaborating Online Respectfully</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">A primer for learners on how to use the school
            network appropriately. This unit builds in time for teacher-led
            discussions on why appropriate usage is important, as well as
            allowing for opportunities to highlight online safety issues.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Using Media –
            Gaining Support for a Cause</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">Do you want your learners to change the world?
            Here’s a good place to start. They will develop a deeper
            understanding of information technology and digital literacy by
            using their skills across the unit to create a blog post about a
            real world cause that they are passionate about and would like to
            gain support for.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Modelling Data –
            Spreadsheets</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">Introduce your learners to the wonderful world
            of spreadsheets and the concept of cell referencing. Ask them to
            collect, analyse, and manipulate data, before turning it into graphs
            and charts. Data is beautiful!</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Networks</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body"> Imagine a world without computer networks:
            there would be no more YouTube, Google, instant messaging, online
            video gaming, Netflix, and iTunes; no online shopping; no file
            sharing; and no central backups of information. This unit begins by
            defining a network and addressing the benefits of networking, before
            covering how data is transmitted across networks using protocols.

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Programming I</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">This unit is the first programming unit of KS3.
            The aim of this unit and the following unit (Programming II) is to
            build learners’ confidence and knowledge of the key programming
            constructs. Importantly, this unit does not assume any previous
            programming experience, but it does offer learners the opportunity
            to expand on their knowledge throughout the unit. The main
            programming concepts covered in this unit are sequencing, variables,
            selection, and count-controlled iteration. All of the examples and
            activities for this unit use Scratch 3.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Programming II</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">This unit begins right where ‘Programming I’
            left off. Learners will build on their understanding of the control
            structures’ sequence, selection, and iteration (the big three), and
            develop their problem-solving skills. Learners will learn how to
            create their own subroutines, develop their understanding of
            decomposition, learn how to create and use lists, and build upon
            their problem-solving skills by working through a larger project at
            the end of the unit.</p>
