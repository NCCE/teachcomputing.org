            the symbols computers use to perform these tasks and focus on the
            representation of text and numbers.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Today, there’s an app for every possible need. With this unit you
          can take learners through the entire process of creating their own mobile app, using
          App Lab from code.org. Building on the programming concepts learners used in previous units,
          they will work in pairs to perform user research, design their app, write the code for it,
          before finally evaluating and publishing it for the world to use.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Introduction to Python Programming</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">This unit introduces learners to text-based programming with Python.
            <br>The lessons form a journey that starts with simple programs involving input and output, and gradually moves on through arithmetic operations, randomness, selection, and iteration. Emphasis is placed on tackling common misconceptions and elucidating the mechanics of program execution.
            <br>A range of pedagogical tools is employed throughout the unit, with the most prominent being pair programming, live coding, and worked examples.
            <br>The <%= link_to 'Year 7 Programming', '#year-7', class: 'ncce-link' %> units are a prerequisite for this unit.</p>
