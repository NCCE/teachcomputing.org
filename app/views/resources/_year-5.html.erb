            and networks – Sharing information</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">In this unit, learners will develop their
            understanding of computer systems and how information is transferred
            between systems and devices. Learners will consider small-scale
            systems as well as large-scale systems. They will explain the input,
            output, and process aspects of a variety of different real-world
            systems. Learners will also take part in a collaborative online
            project with other class members and develop their skills in working
            together online.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Creating media – Vector drawing</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">In this unit learners will find out that vector images are made up of shapes. They will learn how to use the different drawing tools and how images are created in layers. They will explore the ways in which images can be grouped and duplicated to support them in creating more complex pieces of work. This unit is planned using the Google Drawings app other alternative pieces of software are available.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s resources-year__title">Creating media – Video editing</h4>
          <p class="govuk-body">This unit gives learners the opportunity to learn how to create short videos in groups.
          As they progress through this unit, they will be exposed to topic-based language and develop the skills of
          capturing, editing, and manipulating video. Active learning is encouraged through guided questions and by
          working in small groups to investigate the use of devices and software. Learners are guided with step-by-step
          support to take their idea from conception to completion. At the teacher’s discretion, the use of green screen
          can be incorporated into this unit. At the conclusion of the unit, learners have the opportunity to reflect on
          and assess their progress in creating a video.</p>
