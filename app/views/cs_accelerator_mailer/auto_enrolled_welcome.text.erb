Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,
Did you know that you're already well on your way to gaining a nationally recognised qualification?

We can see you've been working on your professional development, by engaging in courses from the Computer Science Accelerator programme on TeachComputing.org (https://teachcomputing.org/). To help you take the next step towards achieving your certificate in computer science subject knowledge, which is awarded by BCS and accredited by the Royal Academy of Engineering, we've enrolled you on the programme.

This means that you'll now be able to access your own personal dashboard, where you can  find out more about the programme and explore a range of resources and support, including our handbook (http://ncce.io/csa-handbook), which will walk you through what to expect over the course of the programme.

2. Explore your personalised dashboard which shows you the learning pathway and courses we recommend you take
3. Complete a minimum of ten hours of CPD, which must include a face to face or remote course
4. Use our mock test to check what you’ve learnt
5. When you’re ready, take and pass our test to receive your certificate
