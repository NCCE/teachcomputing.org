Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Did you know you're already well on your way to completing our Computer Science Accelerator programme?

We can see you've been working on your professional development, by engaging in CPD from TeachComputing.org. (https://teachcomputing.org/)
To help you take the next step to achieve a nationally recognised certificate, we've enrolled you on our programme.

This means that you'll now be able to access your own personal dashboard, where you can  find out more about the programme and explore a range of resources and support, including our handbook (http://ncce.io/csa-handbook), which will walk you through what to expect over the course of the programme.

Your subject knowledge certificate is awarded by BCS and accredited by the Royal Academy of Engineering,  and can even set you on the path towards chartered status.
