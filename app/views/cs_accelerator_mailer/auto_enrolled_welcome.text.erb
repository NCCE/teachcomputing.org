Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Did you know that you're already well on your way to gaining a nationally recognised certificate?

We can see you've been working on your professional development, by engaging in courses that are part of the Subject knowledge certificate on TeachComputing.org (<%= root_url %>). To help you take the next step towards achieving this national accreditation in computer science subject knowledge, which is awarded by BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, we've enrolled you on the certificate.

This means that you'll now be able to access your own personal dashboard, where you can find out more about the certificate and explore a range of resources and support, including our handbook (<%= csa_handbook_url %>), which will walk you through what to expect over the course of your learning.Button:
