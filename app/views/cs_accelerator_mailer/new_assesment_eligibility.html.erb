  <p class='govuk-body'>Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>We have recently made some changes to the Computer
    Science Accelerator Programme to make it even more flexible and applicable
    for teachers with different levels of experience. As part of these changes,
    you can now access the test earlier and decide when you feel that you have
    the subject knowledge to complete the programme.</p>

  <p class='govuk-body'><strong>Ready to take the test?</strong></p>

  <p class='govuk-body'>You are one step away from receiving your qualification
    and being recognised for your subject knowledge.</p>
  <br>Plus, passing this test will mean you will receive your additional Â£920
  bursary upon completion.</p>

  <p class='govuk-body'><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>25 multiple-choice questions
    </li>
    <li>30 minute time limit
    </li>
    <li>Pass mark of 65% required
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class='govuk-body'><strong>Not quite ready?</strong></p>

  <p class='govuk-body'>If you don't feel comfortable enough to take the test
    just yet, we have a range of remote and online CPD to help you bridge any
    knowledge gaps and help to build your confidence in teaching computing.
    Plus, you can contact our <%= mail_to 'CSChampionSupport@stem.org.uk', 'Computer Science Champions'%> for guidance and one-to-one revision support.</p>
