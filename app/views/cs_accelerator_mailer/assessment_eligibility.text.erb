Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Congratulations on your professional development progress! You have now completed the required hours of CPD to unlock the Key stage 3 and 4 subject knowledge certificate test.

Take the test now (approximately 30 minutes) and obtain your accredited certificate. 

How does it work?

-  The test is timed and multiple choice
- It should be taken under exam conditions, and you'll need to provide contact details of a member of your leadership team who can confirm this

Need more support? 

Take our mock test (https://www.classmarker.com/online-test/start/?quiz=gq36013dee29b07b) to assess your subject knowledge and identify any areas from the curriculum where you need further support. We also have resources to help you prepare for your test, including:

- Preparing to take the test (short course) (<%= course_url(id: 'CP350', name: 'preparing-to-take-the-csa-test-short-course') %>)
- CSA Handbook (https://ncce.io/csa-handbook)

We also recommend you complete more courses on your chosen pathway to ensure you possess well-rounded subject knowledge before attempting to take the test.

Depending on your starting point, you may also benefit from engaging in CPD from one of our other pathways, which you can access via your certificate dashboard (<%= cs_accelerator_certificate_url %>). Alternatively, you can browse our full range of training via our courses page (<%= courses_url(certificate: @programme.slug) %>).


If you work in state-funded education, you may also be eligible for a subsidy (https://teachcomputing.org/funding#secondary-subsidy) to support supply cover for continuing professional development, paid to your school or college.Plus, your local Computing Hub (<%= hubs_url %>) is on-hand to provide guidance and support at any time.

Good luck!
