  Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

  Did you know that you're already well on your way to gaining a nationally recognised certificate?

  We can see you've been working on your professional development, by engaging in courses that are part of the Teach secondary computing certificate on TeachComputing.org. To help you take the next step towards achieving this national accreditation, which is awarded by BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, we've enrolled you on the certificate.

  This means that you'll now be able to access your own personal dashboard, where you can find out more about the certificate and the next steps required to achieve it.
  Explore your personal dashboard (<%= secondary_certificate_url %>)

  Next steps...
    * Explore your dashboard which shows courses and activities for you to engage with
    * Complete a minimum of six hours of CPD (<%= courses_url(certificate: "secondary-certificate") %>) – you might have already achieved that part of the certificate!
    * Develop your teaching practice – a great place to start is downloading and using a Teach Computing Curriculum resource (<%= curriculum_key_stages_url %>) then reflecting on how you adapted it in the classroom
    * Support your professional community – to achieve this you could review your school’s progress in developing an exemplary computing curriculum through the Computing Quality Framework (<%= computing_quality_framework_url %>)
    * Ensure you have completed the Key Stage 3 and GCSE computer science (<%= cs_accelerator_certificate_url %>) subject knowledge certificate
    * Receive your nationally accredited certificate!

  Not the right time?
  If you don't want to continue on the programme at this time, let us know and we'll update our records. You can still re-enrol yourself in the future on our website. (<%= secondary_certificate_url %>)
