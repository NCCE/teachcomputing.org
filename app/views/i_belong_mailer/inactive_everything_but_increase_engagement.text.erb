Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,
Congratulations on your progress towards completing the I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science programme. Take the next step to achieving a nationally recognised certificate to show your school’s commitment to improving girls’ uptake of computer science by offering enrichment opportunities for your students to bring the subject to life. Why not start by reviewing your action plan (<%= i_belong_action_plan_url %>) to see what you and your school previously planned to do?

From participating in one of our new I Belong student events to bringing a Computing Ambassador (<%= stem_ambassadors_url %>) into your classroom to provide a real-world example of a career in computer science, there are plenty of options designed to help you increase girls’ engagement in the subject.

View recommended activities in you handbook (<%= i_belong_handbook_url %>)

Already completed these activities?
Has your school completed some of the activities required to achieve the certificate? Remember to tick them off by submitting evidence (<%= structuring_your_i_belong_evidence_url %>) in your dashboard.
