Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Thank you for recently signing up to I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science. We hope you have already started to explore and take advantage of our resources.

As part of the programme, and if you are teaching key stage 3 specifically, you can access ready-made student surveys (https://ncce.io/student-survey) designed to help you understand your cohorts’ attitudes and perceptions of computing and computer science. Each survey link comes with a report link unique to you, enabling you to analyse the data and helping you design student interventions. Follow-up surveys are available on programme completion to help you understand the impact of your interventions.

Request your survey links today

To obtain your survey links, please visit our student surveys page (https://ncce.io/student-survey) on Teach Computing.
