  <p class="govuk-body">Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Congratulations on your progress towards completing the I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science programme. Take the next step to achieving a nationally recognised certificate to show your school’s commitment to improving girls’ uptake of computer science by offering enrichment opportunities for your students to bring the subject to life.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Why not start by reviewing your <%= link_to 'action plan', i_belong_action_plan_url %> to see what you and your school previously planned to do?
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    From participating in one of our new I Belong <%= link_to 'student events',  ncce_student_events_url %> to bringing a <%= link_to 'Computing Ambassador', stem_ambassadors_url %> into your classroom to provide a real-world example of a career in computer science, there are plenty of options designed to help you increase girls’ engagement in the subject.

     curriculum resources, aligned to evidence-based approaches supporting girls' engagement (look for the I Belong flag).
