Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Congratulations on your progress towards completing the I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science programme. Take the next step towards achieving a nationally recognised certificate to show your school’s commitment to improving girls’ uptake of computer science by engaging with free, evidence-informed resources to progress your practice.

Discover our handbook, which includes a wealth of information and guidance, and access our I Belong in Computer Science posters, a resource for your classroom to showcase inspiring careers in computer science. We also encourage you to utilise our recommended key stage 3 curriculum resources, aligned to evidence-based approaches supporting girls' engagement.

There are additional resources to support your engagement with female students – use our DIY posters (<%= cms_post_url(page_slug: "i-belong-poster-template") %>) and key stage 3 student surveys (<%= cms_page_url(page_slug: "student-surveys-attitudes-to-computing") %>) to inspire girls through relatable role models and gain better understanding of the attitudes towards computing education in your school.
