Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Congratulations on your progress towards completing the I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science programme. Take the next step towards achieving a nationally recognised certificate to show your school's commitment to improving girls' uptake of computer science by engaging with free, evidence-informed resources to progress your practice.

Discover our handbook, which includes a wealth of information and guidance, and access our I Belong in Computer Science posters, a resource for your classroom to showcase inspiring careers in computer science. We also encourage you to utilise our recommended curriculum resources, aligned to evidence-based approaches supporting girls' engagement.

You can also use the additional resources like our DIY posters (<%= cms_post_url(page_slug: "i-belong-poster-template") %>) to support your engagement with female students, inspiring more girls through relatable role models.

For those of you teaching key stage 3 - we recommend using our student surveys (<%= cms_page_url(page_slug: "student-surveys-attitudes-to-computing") %>) to gain better understanding of the attitudes towards computing education in your school.
