Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Congratulations on your progress towards completing the I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science programme.

Now that your school has undertaken a range of activities to improve girls’ participation in computer science, consolidate your learning by engaging in professional development. The evidence-informed primary (<%= course_url('CP409') %>) or secondary (<%= course_url('CP440') %>) short courses developed by our specialists will help you reflect on what you’ve done so far and plan and explore different strategies to use inside and outside the classroom. It’s free to attend if you work in a state-funded school or college, which means there is no limit to the number of teachers in your school who can benefit from this course.
