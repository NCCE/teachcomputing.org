  <p class='govuk-body'>Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    We can see you've been working on your professional development by engaging in our Encouraging girls into GCSE computer science course.
    We're assuming from your interest in this course that you would be interested in our <%= link_to 'I Belong: encouraging girls into computer science', '/i-belong' %> programme.
  </p>
  <p class='govuk-body'>
    As such, we've enrolled you on the programme, giving you access to a wider range of resources designed to help your school achieve your goals.
    If you don't want to continue the programme at this time, let us know, and we will update our records. You can still re-enrol yourself in the future <%= link_to 'on our website', '/i-belong' %>.

    Ideas to get you started
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Provide access for students to a computing-related STEM lunchtime or after-school club and show how your approach is gender responsive. You and your colleagues may be doing this already and be ready to submit your evidence.</li>
  	<li>Maximise our recommended key stage 3 curriculum resources, aligned to evidence-based approaches supporting girls' engagement in computer science.
    Examples include
    <%= link_to 'Clear messaging in digital media, Developing for the Web', '/curriculum/key-stage-3/clear-messaging-in-digital-media' %>,
    and
    <%= link_to 'Media - Animations', 'https://teachcomputing.org/curriculum/key-stage-3/media-animations' %>.</li>
