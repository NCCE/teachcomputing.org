# NCCE

## Development

### Dependencies:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Docker (incl. Docker Compose, which already part of Docker for Mac and Docker Toolbox)
- Node & NPM

### Setup

Builds the docker image, sets up environment variables, and adds nicer a local hostname:
```
npm run setup
```

In order for OAuth to work with STEM you will need to make sure you have an `id` and `secret` set. You get these from [here](https://github.com/NCCE/private-documentation/blob/master/OAuth2/stem-oauth2.md).

If you want to skip the OAuth flow you can set `BYPASS_OAUTH` to `true` in your `.env` file. This will log you in as `web@raspberrypi.org`.

Optionally set a password for postgres by updating the value for `DEV_PASS` in your `.env` file.

### Starting and stopping the stack

Start the stack:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Or (to automatically create an ssh tunnel, poll for the env to start and open a new tab):
```
npm start
```

Stop the stack:
```
docker-compose down
```
Or (to also gracefully close the tunnel)
```
npm stop
```

The app is available at: http://local.teachcomputing.org

In order to access the achiever API you will need to ensure you have a proxy setup. You can do this [here](https://github.com/NCCE/private-documentation/blob/master/APIs/rpf-proxy.md)

Sidekiq is used to process background jobs. You can view the admin UI for this by visiting `/admin/sidekiq` and using the credentials `SIDEKIQ_USERNAME` and `SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD`. Values for these can be found in the terraform repository.

### Database

The database is automatically setup the first time the container is run, and a migration is performed on each subsequent run.

#### Reset the database

Since the setup is run via rails it's easiest to bring the entire stack down.
```
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

You can also target the db volume with the following, however you'll need to bring the web container down and up again too.
```
docker-compose rm -sv db
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Run migrations

To perform migrations manually (without restarting the container) run:
```
docker-compose run --rm web bin/rails db:migrate
```

####Â Seeding the database

To seed manually run:
```
docker-compose run web bin/rails db:seed
```

### Install new Dependencies

Add the dependency to the Gemfile or package.json and run:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
```

## Testing

Uses [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec)
```
docker-compose run --rm web bin/rspec
```
Or
```
npm test
```

To use [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) to watch the tests:
```
docker-compose run --rm web bin/guard
```
Or
```
npm run guard
```

## Sitemaps

Sitemaps are generated via `sitemap:refresh`, which is managed by a scheduled task on Heroku. They can be found in the `public` directory.

## Tooling

### ERB Lint

Used for linting ERB / HTML files

Run with `bundle exec erblint --lint-all`

https://github.com/Shopify/erb-lint

### Reek

Used for detecting 'code smell' in your app.

Run with `bundle exec reek`

### Brakeman

Used for static code analysis to check for potential security flaws.

https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/quickstart/

We are ignoring some of the warnings using the method described in the [Brakeman docs](https://brakemanscanner.org/docs/ignoring_false_positives/) We are using the default location for the ignore file, etc.

Run `brakeman -i config/brakeman.ignore .` in the project root and follow the onscreen prompts, outlined in the above doc, to use the tool and check the output for warnings, etc.

### Debugging

Set `OAUTH_DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file for more useful OAUTH logging.
