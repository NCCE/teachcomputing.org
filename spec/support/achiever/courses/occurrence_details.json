Every piece of software, and the instructions and data it contains, is made up of 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s, pushed around the parts of a computer system.<\/p>\u000a<p>This course opens the box, looking at the components of a computer, what they do and how they work together in computer systems. You&rsquo;ll learn about the processor that sits at the centre, as well as memory, storage and the other key pieces of hardware.<\/p>\u000a<p>Mapped closely to the specifications of GCSE computer science, the course will provide you with deepened knowledge and confidence to equip your students with for their exams.<\/p>\u000a<p>Bursaries exist to support you through 40 hours of CPD to complete the CS Accelerator programme. If you don&rsquo;t complete the programme, we reserve the right to reclaim any bursaries paid.<\/p>",
