It&rsquo;s important for young people to develop their knowledge of how these devices work, so that they can appreciate the impacts that computers and networks have on the world around them. <br \/><br \/>On this three-week course you&rsquo;ll explore how you can build up young learners&rsquo; knowledge in an age-appropriate manner. You&rsquo;ll start by thinking about how you can to help your learners recognise information technology - and how computers process an input to give an output.<\/p>\u000a<p><br \/><br \/><strong>Networking <\/strong><\/p>\u000a<p>In the second week of the course, you&rsquo;ll learn about the key pieces of technology that allow us to connect computers into networks, and the advantages that networks can bring.
