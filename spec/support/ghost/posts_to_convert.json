The same survey revealed secondary teachers spend 77% of their time on non-teaching tasks. 1 in 4 teachers were considering leaving the profession last year with \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/03/teachers-stress-workload-survey-national-education-union?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003e92% of those citing unmanageable workload as a reason. \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLosing experienced staff from teaching is a national tragedy for young people, while the stress of excess workload contributes to burnout of our valued professionals. For all these reasons, as subject leaders we must do what we can to reduce workload. Below are some top tips for computing leaders to tackle high workloads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"planning-and-resources\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlanning and Resources\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Use a centralised curriculum.\u003c/strong\u003e Do not ask teachers to plan their own schemes of work or provide individual lesson plans. The free \u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/curriculum?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003eTeach Computing Curriculum\u003c/a\u003e (TCC) provides a solid foundation for KS1 to KS4 Computer Science, and any adaptation needed for your context should be performed as a team and stored in a shared folder. See our course \u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/courses/CP255/implementing-the-teach-computing-curriculum-in-your-school?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eCP255\u003c/a\u003e (Primary) or \u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/courses/CP461/introduction-to-the-teach-computing-curriculum-short-course?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eCP461\u003c/a\u003e (Secondary) for more help implementing the TCC. Consider also supplementing it with \u003ca href=\"https://isaaccomputerscience.org/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eIsaac Computer Science\u003c/a\u003e, a free \"online textbook\" with interactive content and practice questions, also free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Exploit generative AI (gAI).\u003c/strong\u003e Try out gAI tools such as \u003ca href=\"https://chat.openai.com/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eChatGPT\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003ePerplexity\u003c/a\u003e to write lesson content, for example, multiple choice questions for a “Do Now” retrieval practice quiz. Alternatively, learners could prompt gAI to explain topics to them when revising, and ask the tools questions to deepen their understanding. And Harvard’s free \u003ca href=\"https://cs50.ai/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eCS50.ai\u003c/a\u003e has been trained to help students write code, so why not get students “rubber-ducking” with it in class? See my \u003ca href=\"https://blog.teachcomputing.org/generative-ai-tools-in-teaching-and-learning/\"\u003eearlier blog on gAI\u003c/a\u003e for more advice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"staffing-and-staff-development\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStaffing and staff development\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Timetable developing teachers well.\u003c/strong\u003e If you have any control over this, consider the best way to allocate non-specialists and ECTs such that they cover less content within a cycle. For example, if a non-specialist teaches all of Year 8 instead of a mix of Years 7, 8 and 9, they will teach the same lesson many times in a week, rather than lots of different lessons. This can reduce their planning and improve the effectiveness of their lessons dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"teaching-and-learning\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeaching and Learning\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Try flipped learning.\u003c/strong\u003e I’ve had great success in KS4 and 5 setting self-study homework ahead of the lesson, which reduces the time spent delivering the content. This frees up lesson time for more valuable application work such as guided practice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can set a section of \u003ca href=\"https://isaaccomputerscience.org/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eIsaac\u003c/a\u003e for homework, (or one of the websites listed in the teacher guide of a unit in the \u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/curriculum?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eTCC\u003c/a\u003e), and ask the students to summarise the content in a “\u003ca href=\"https://www.tes.com/magazine/archive/30-second-briefing-what-sketchnoting?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003esketchnote\u003c/a\u003e” or in \u003ca href=\"https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eCornell Notes\u003c/a\u003e. This takes time to get right and isn’t for every setting, but when it works the payoff is remarkable. See this \u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/blog/how-craigndave-were-ahead-of-the-game-in-going-virtual?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eNCCE blog\u003c/a\u003e for further discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) Provide self-study websites.\u003c/strong\u003e Sometimes it’s not possible for the teacher to be everything to every pupil. Learners may achieve more with access to self-study websites such as \u003ca href=\"https://isaaccomputerscience.org/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eIsaac Computer Science\u003c/a\u003e. Just set up your classes and invite the students. They are free to study at will, you can assign gameboards to direct their attention and gather some progress data at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"inclusion\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6) Use accessibility tools. \u003c/strong\u003eThe range of technology available to assist learners with additional needs and those with English as an additional language is now vast - we’ve come a long way since Google Translate and the much-maligned Windows Magnifier! Microsoft’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/education/products/learning-tools?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eImmersive Reader\u003c/a\u003e is an integral part of all 365 products and is also in the Edge browser. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt provides font changing and resizing options, text-to-speech, dictionary, and translate features. I always make my teaching resources available on a shared drive and show learners how to use the tool, rather than creating multiple supporting resources every lesson. Chrome extensions are  available to add similar features to Google Suite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"marking-and-feedback\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarking and feedback\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7) Set MCQs.\u003c/strong\u003e Instead of written assessments, make good use of self-marking multiple-choice questions (MCQs) such as those available in the TCC \u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/secondary-question-banks?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eSecondary Question Banks\u003c/a\u003e and Diagnostic Questions’ \u003ca href=\"https://diagnosticquestions.com/Quantum?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eProject Quantum\u003c/a\u003e. Primary teachers can get \u003ca href=\"https://chat.openai.com/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eChatGPT\u003c/a\u003e to create theirs. Good quality self-marked quizzes can provide sufficient data for most purposes. Supplement this with quality in-lesson formative assessment and you should not need to mark a book again!

Teams now allows you to set \u003ca href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/education-blog/introducing-python-and-jupyter-notebooks-support-in-microsoft/ba-p/3712036?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003ePython notebooks as assignments\u003c/a\u003e, or you can mark \u003ca href=\"https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eCornell Notes\u003c/a\u003e flipped homework for a whole class in about ten minutes!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"communications\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommunications\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9) Tame the email menace! \u003c/strong\u003eEmail is quick and easy to use, and therefore it gets used for everything. Untamed, email use spirals out of control and important messages get drowned out by the noise. As subject leader, I always sent a “weekly update” email containing everything my team needed to know and held a fortnightly team meeting with an agenda that all could add to. We used Teams for everything else and barely sent an email. I wrote a blog with much more advice \u003ca href=\"https://httcs.online/2023/03/25/email-menace/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"behaviour\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBehaviour\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10) Run centralised detentions. \u003c/strong\u003eWhen it comes to behaviour sanctions, their \u003cstrong\u003ecertainty \u003c/strong\u003eand \u003cstrong\u003eimmediacy\u003c/strong\u003e are more important than their severity (see \u003ca href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/i-want-broad-range-of-schools-for-new-network-says-dfe-behaviour-tsar-bennett/?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\"\u003eadvice from Tom Bennett\u003c/a\u003e). If a pupil knows they will \u003cem\u003edefinitely\u003c/em\u003e be kept after school they will be less likely to risk bad choices. Better behaviour means more progress for the learners and less work for the teacher. If your school doesn’t run detentions centrally, work out a schedule in co-operation with other, nearby subject leaders. I also recommend the NCCE course “\u003ca href=\"https://teachcomputing.org/courses/CP468/behaviour-for-learning-in-a-computing-environment-short-course?ref=blog.teachcomputing.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\"\u003eCP468 Behaviour for learning in a computing environment\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"summary\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eComputing leaders are uniquely positioned to use technology to reduce workload, not just in their own department but – through setting an example and sharing best practice – across the school. We have powerful technology in our classrooms and more skill than most to make the most of it. Make use of these top tips and the suggested NCCE resources, and you too can make a big difference in your school!\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the author\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlan Harrison (@MrAHarrisonCS) is a National Specialist in Secondary Computing Leadership at the National Centre for Computing Education. \u003c/p\u003e",
