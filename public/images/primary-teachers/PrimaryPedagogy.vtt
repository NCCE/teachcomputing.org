What taxonomies and
learning theories

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
can you use to teach programming
to primary school pupils aged

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:90%
5 to 11?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.570 align:middle line:84%
How can you model a learning
sequence as a semantic wave?

This free course will teach
you about pedagogical concepts

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
like Bloom's Taxonomy,

You'll take part in
practical activities

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
to design lessons using
levels of abstraction,
